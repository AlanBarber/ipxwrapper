Version 0.2.2:
	Feature: Redesigned ipxconfig UI.
	
	Cleanup: Use wrapper function to read registry values in ipxconfig.
	
	Bugfix: Only create registry key when saving configuration.
	
	Bugfix: Correctly order interfaces when first interface has the force
	primary flag set.
	
	Bugfix: Added missing exports to wsock32.dll and mswsock.dll.
	
	Update: Log DLL and function names in ipxwrapper.log when call logging
	is enabled.
	
	Bugfix: Correctly terminate stub DLL names.

Version 0.2.1:
	Bugfix: Delay stub DLL LoadLibrary calls until first API call as using
	LoadLibrary in DllMain crashes under some conditions.
	
	Bugfix: Updated recv, recvfrom and WSARecvEx functions to release mutex
	before calling recv to avoid deadlocks in multithreaded applications.
	
	Bugfix: Correctly terminate symbol names used within stub DLLs.
	
	Cleanup: Combined common code between recv, recvfrom and WSARecvEx.
	
	Feature: Optionally log names of all WinSock calls.
	
	Bugfix: Store correct DLL name in stub DLLs.
	
	Cleanup: Replace assert calls with proper error checks in ipxconfig.
	
	Cleanup: Cleaned up logging code and added timestamps using GetTickCount.
	
	Cleanup: Call r_ winsock calls directly in router code to prevent it from
	generating extra log messages.
	
	Bugfix: Fixed buffer overflow when converting certain addresses to text.

Version 0.2:
	Implemented ioctlsocket() function with support for FIONREAD.
	
	Load interface settings from the registry.
	
	Wrote graphical configuration program.
	
	Store IPX network/node number in the NIC structure and a pointer to the
	bound interface in the socket structure.
	
	Host addresses referenced by IPX network AND node numbers, expire 60
	seconds after the last recieved packet.
	
	Updated winsock wrapper functions to behave closer to the original
	winsock implementation.
	
	Only require SO_BROADCAST for receiving broadcast packets if the win95
	SO_BROADCAST bug is enabled, which it is by default.
	
	Restrict UDP broadcasts and receives to selected interfaces by default.
	
	Allow UDP port to be changed in configuration program.
	
	Store router buffer globally so it can be free'd rather than leaking
	64KiB every time the IPXWrapper DLL is unloaded.
	
	Changed Makefile to build stripped binaries.

Version 0.1:
	Initial release
